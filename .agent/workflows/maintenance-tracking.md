description: Handling tenant maintenance requests and AI-assisted responses
---

This workflow covers tracking maintenance issues and using AI to draft professional responses to tenants.

### Steps:

1. **Navigate to Maintenance**: Click on **Maintenance** in the sidebar.
2. **Review Requests**: See a list of all issues reported by tenants, categorized by status (New, In Progress, Completed).
3. **Draft Response**:
   - For any "New" or "In Progress" request, click **Draft Response**.
   - An automated response generator will appear, drafted based on the issue details.
4. **Communicate with Tenant**: Review the AI-generated draft, refine it if necessary, and use it to update the tenant on the status of their request.
5. **Update Status**: Once resolved, ensure the request status is updated to **Completed** to keep your records accurate.
